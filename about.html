                    Hello, my name is <span>Ahmad Baehaqi</span> but many pople call me <span>Abay</span>, and I am a full stack developer with a passion for 
                    building robust and efficient web applications. My journey in web development began five years ago, and since then, I have worked on several projects that range from e-commerce websites to social media platforms.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     I am proficient in several programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and PHP, and I have experience working with modern frontend frameworks such as React and Angular. I also have experience working with backend frameworks such as Express and Django.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     My focus as a developer is to build high-quality and scalable applications that solve real-world problems. I am a team player and a fast learner, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     When I am not coding, you can find me hiking, reading, or playing basketball. I believe that a healthy work-life balance is essential for productivity and overall well-being.
                 </p>
